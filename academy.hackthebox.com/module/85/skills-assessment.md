# Intro to Assembly Language
1. Disassemble 'loaded_shellcode' and modify its assembly code to decode the shellcode, by adding a loop to 'xor' each 8-bytes on the stack with the key in 'rbx'.
```sh
HTB{4553mbly_d3bugg1ng_m4573r}
```
2. The above server simulates a vulnerable server that we can run our shellcodes on. Optimize 'flag.s' for shellcoding and get it under 50 bytes, then send the shellcode to get the flag. (Feel free to find/create a custom shellcode)
```sh
HTB{5h3llc0d1ng_g3n1u5}
```
